# react-bot
A very WIP expriement to see if a discord bot can be written in react

## Installing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yamboy1/react-bot
```

## Setup
Rename `secrets.example.js` to `secrets.js` and put your discord token in the `token` variable

## Running
Make sure that all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`
then run `npm start` to compile and run the bot
